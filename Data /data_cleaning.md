# Data Terms and Definitions

## Clean Data
- **Definition**: Data that is complete, correct, and relevant to the problem being solved.
- **Additional Notes**: Clean data is essential for accurate analysis and decision-making. It ensures that the insights derived from the data are reliable.

## Compatibility
- **Definition**: How well two or more datasets are able to work together.
- **Additional Notes**: Compatibility is crucial when integrating data from different sources. It ensures that the data can be combined without errors or inconsistencies.

## CONCATENATE
- **Definition**: A spreadsheet function that joins together two or more text strings.
- **Example**: `=CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1)` combines the text in cells A1 and B1 with a space in between.

## Conditional Formatting
- **Definition**: A spreadsheet tool that changes how cells appear when values meet specific conditions.
- **Example**: Highlighting all cells with values greater than 100 in red.

## Data Engineer
- **Definition**: A professional who transforms data into a useful format for analysis and provides it with a reliable infrastructure.
- **Additional Notes**: Data engineers often work with big data technologies and ensure that data pipelines are efficient and scalable.

## Data Mapping
- **Definition**: The process of matching fields from one data source to another.
- **Additional Notes**: Data mapping is essential for data integration and migration projects.

## Data Merging
- **Definition**: The process of combining two or more datasets into a single dataset.
- **Additional Notes**: Data merging is often used in data analysis to create a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources.

## Data Validation
- **Definition**: A tool for checking the accuracy and quality of data.
- **Additional Notes**: Data validation helps ensure that the data meets certain criteria before it is used for analysis.

## Data Warehousing Specialist
- **Definition**: A professional who develops processes and procedures to effectively store and organize data.
- **Additional Notes**: Data warehousing specialists focus on optimizing data storage and retrieval for analytical purposes.

## Delimiter
- **Definition**: A character that indicates the beginning or end of a data item.
- **Example**: A comma (`,`) in a CSV file.

## Dirty Data
- **Definition**: Data that is incomplete, incorrect, or irrelevant to the problem to be solved.
- **Additional Notes**: Dirty data can lead to inaccurate analysis and poor decision-making.

## Duplicate Data
- **Definition**: Any record that inadvertently shares data with another record.
- **Additional Notes**: Duplicate data can skew analysis results and should be removed before analysis.

## Field Length
- **Definition**: A tool for determining how many characters can be keyed into a spreadsheet field.
- **Additional Notes**: Field length constraints help maintain data consistency and prevent errors.

## Incomplete Data
- **Definition**: Data that is missing important fields.
- **Additional Notes**: Incomplete data can lead to biased or incomplete analysis.

## Inconsistent Data
- **Definition**: Data that uses different formats to represent the same thing.
- **Example**: Representing dates as `MM/DD/YYYY` in one dataset and `DD-MM-YYYY` in another.

## Incorrect/Inaccurate Data
- **Definition**: Data that is complete but inaccurate.
- **Additional Notes**: Incorrect data can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.

## LEFT
- **Definition**: A function that returns a set number of characters from the left side of a text string.
- **Example**: `=LEFT(A1, 5)` returns the first 5 characters from the text in cell A1.

## LEN
- **Definition**: A function that returns the length of a text string by counting the number of characters it contains.
- **Example**: `=LEN(A1)` returns the number of characters in cell A1.

## Length
- **Definition**: The number of characters in a text string.
- **Additional Notes**: Length is often used in data validation to ensure that text strings meet certain criteria.

## Merger
- **Definition**: An agreement that unites two organizations into a single new one.
- **Additional Notes**: In data terms, a merger may involve combining datasets from the two organizations.

## MID
- **Definition**: A function that returns a segment from the middle of a text string.
- **Example**: `=MID(A1, 3, 5)` returns 5 characters starting from the 3rd character in cell A1.

## Null
- **Definition**: An indication that a value does not exist in a dataset.
- **Additional Notes**: Null values can affect calculations and should be handled appropriately.

## Outdated Data
- **Definition**: Any data that has been superseded by newer and more accurate information.
- **Additional Notes**: Using outdated data can lead to incorrect analysis and decisions.

## Remove Duplicates
- **Definition**: A spreadsheet tool that automatically searches for and eliminates duplicate entries from a spreadsheet.
- **Additional Notes**: Removing duplicates is essential for ensuring data accuracy.

## Split
- **Definition**: A function that divides text around a specified character and puts each fragment into a new, separate cell.
- **Example**: Splitting a full name into first and last names using a space as the delimiter.

## Substring
- **Definition**: A smaller subset of a text string.
- **Additional Notes**: Substrings are often used in data manipulation and analysis.

## Text String
- **Definition**: A group of characters within a cell, most often composed of letters.
- **Additional Notes**: Text strings can include letters, numbers, and special characters.

## TRIM
- **Definition**: A function that removes leading, trailing, and repeated spaces in data.
- **Example**: `=TRIM(A1)` removes extra spaces from the text in cell A1.

## Unique
- **Definition**: A value that canâ€™t have a duplicate.
- **Additional Notes**: Unique values are often used as identifiers in datasets.
