Please note that I cannot conduct an actual "interview quiz" with real-time feedback or score tracking. However, I can provide you with a **list of 20 interview-style questions** covering the topics we've discussed (Virtualization, Cloud Computing, and AWS). You can use this as a self-assessment tool or for practice.

I'll provide the questions and then, for your convenience, I'll also provide the answers separately at the end. Try to answer them first before looking at the solutions!

**Quiz Answers (No peeking until you've tried to answer!)**

**Section 1: Virtualization Fundamentals**

1.  **What is the primary purpose of virtualization?**
    The primary purpose is to create simulated versions of physical computing resources (like servers, storage, networks) to maximize hardware utilization, improve resource efficiency, and enable multiple isolated environments on a single physical machine.

2.  **Explain the concept of a Virtual Machine (VM).**
    A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer system. It runs its own operating system and applications and functions like a separate physical computer, but it shares the underlying physical hardware resources with other VMs.

3.  **Differentiate between a Type 1 and a Type 2 hypervisor. Provide an example for each.**
    * **Type 1 (Bare-Metal/Native) Hypervisor:** Installs directly on the physical hardware, managing resources directly. It doesn't require a host OS.
        * *Example:* VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM.
    * **Type 2 (Hosted) Hypervisor:** Runs as an application on top of a conventional operating system (the host OS).
        * *Example:* Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.

4.  **List two significant benefits of using virtualization in an IT environment.**
    * Resource Efficiency/Utilization (e.g., running multiple servers on one physical machine)
    * Cost Savings (less hardware, energy, cooling)
    * Flexibility and Scalability (easy to provision/de-provision VMs)
    * Isolation and Security (VMs are isolated from each other)
    * Faster Disaster Recovery

5.  **What is another common name for a hypervisor?**
    Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM).

**Section 2: Cloud Computing Concepts**

6.  **Define cloud computing in your own words.**
    Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing. It allows users to access resources as a utility rather than owning and maintaining them.

7.  **Name and briefly describe the three primary cloud computing service models.**
    * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides fundamental computing resources like VMs, storage, and networks. You manage the OS and above. (e.g., EC2)
    * **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides a complete development and deployment environment. You focus on code; the provider manages the underlying infrastructure, OS, and middleware. (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk)
    * **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Delivers ready-to-use applications over the internet. The provider manages everything. (e.g., Gmail, Salesforce)

8.  **Explain the difference between a public cloud and a private cloud.**
    * **Public Cloud:** Resources are owned and operated by a third-party provider and shared among multiple tenants over the public internet.
    * **Private Cloud:** Cloud resources are used exclusively by a single organization and can be hosted on-site or by a third party.

9.  **What is a "hybrid cloud" and why might an organization choose to use one?**
    A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds, connected by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. Organizations use it for flexibility, to meet specific compliance requirements (keeping sensitive data private), or to optimize costs by bursting less sensitive workloads to the public cloud.

10. **List three key benefits of adopting cloud computing for a business.**
    * Cost Savings (reduces CAPEX)
    * Scalability/Elasticity
    * Agility/Speed of deployment
    * Global Reach
    * Reliability/Business Continuity
    * Increased Collaboration
    * Focus on Core Business

11. **What does "pay-as-you-go" mean in the context of cloud computing?**
    It means you only pay for the computing resources you actually consume, for the duration you use them, without upfront costs or long-term contracts for most services.

12. **Give an example of a SaaS offering.**
    Gmail, Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Dropbox.

**Section 3: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Specifics**

13. **What is Amazon EC2? What type of cloud service model does it primarily fall under?**
    Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides resizable virtual servers (instances) in the cloud. It primarily falls under the **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** model.

14. **Explain the purpose of Amazon S3. What kind of storage is it?**
    Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service designed for high scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It's used for data lakes, backups, static website hosting, and more. It is **object storage**.

15. **If you wanted a managed relational database service on AWS, which service would you use?**
    Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service).

16. **What is AWS Lambda and what is its main advantage?**
    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Its main advantage is that you only pay for the compute time your code consumes, and it automatically scales with demand.

17. **Briefly describe the concept of an "AWS Region" and an "Availability Zone (AZ)."**
    * **AWS Region:** A distinct geographic location that contains multiple isolated data centers.
    * **Availability Zone (AZ):** One or more discrete data centers within an AWS Region, each with independent power, networking, and cooling, designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs.

18. **What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model? Who is responsible for "security *of* the cloud"?**
    The AWS Shared Responsibility Model outlines the security responsibilities between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for "security *of* the cloud" (the underlying infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, and facilities). The customer is responsible for "security *in* the cloud" (their data, applications, OS configuration, network configuration, etc.).

19. **Name two ways you can potentially reduce your EC2 costs if you have predictable, long-term workloads.**
    * Reserved Instances (RIs)
    * Savings Plans

20. **Which AWS service would you use to deliver content (like images or videos) to users globally with low latency?**
    Amazon CloudFront (a Content Delivery Network - CDN).
