# ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) - Getting Started

ETL is a fundamental process in data engineering and analytics that involves:

## 1. What is ETL?
- **Extract**: Pull data from various source systems (databases, APIs, files, etc.)
- **Transform**: Clean, filter, aggregate, and structure the data for analysis
- **Load**: Store the processed data in a target data warehouse or data lake

## 2. Key Components
- **Data Sources**: Databases (SQL, NoSQL), CRM/ERP systems, APIs, flat files
- **ETL Tools**: Informatica, Talend, SSIS, Airflow, or custom scripts
- **Destination**: Data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery) or data lakes

## 3. Basic ETL Process Example

```
Source Database → Extract → Transform (clean, join, aggregate) → Load → Data Warehouse
```

## 4. Common Use Cases
- Data warehousing for business intelligence
- Migrating data between systems
- Creating analytics-ready datasets
- Data integration from multiple sources

## 5. Modern Variations
- **ELT**: Load raw data first, then transform (common in cloud data warehouses)
- **Streaming ETL**: Real-time data processing (Kafka, Spark Streaming)
