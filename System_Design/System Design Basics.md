# System Design Basics for Technical Interviews

Mastering system design is crucial for technical interviews, especially for roles like software engineering, DevOps, and cloud architecture. Here are the key concepts and steps to help you ace your system design interviews.

## Key Principles of System Design

- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load (e.g., more users, data, or requests).
  - **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more resources to a single server (e.g., CPU, RAM).
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers to distribute the load.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring the system works correctly even in the face of failures.
- **Availability**: The system is operational and accessible when needed (measured as a percentage, e.g., 99.9% uptime).
- **Performance**: Low latency and high throughput for user requests.
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update, debug, and extend the system over time.

## Common System Design Components

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
- **Database**: Stores and retrieves data.
  - **Relational (SQL)**: Structured data with relationships (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - **NoSQL**: Unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
- **Caching**: Stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Distributes static content (e.g., images, videos) to servers closer to users for faster access.
- **Message Queue**: Enables asynchronous communication between services (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- **Microservices**: Breaks the system into smaller, independent services that communicate via APIs.

## Steps to Approach a System Design Problem

1. **Clarify Requirements**:
   - Ask questions to understand the scope (e.g., expected traffic, data size, features).
   - Define functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (scalability, latency) requirements.
2. **Estimate Scale**:
   - Calculate traffic, storage, and bandwidth requirements (e.g., requests per second, data size).
3. **High-Level Design**:
   - Sketch the architecture (e.g., client, server, database, caching, load balancer).
   - Identify key components and how they interact.
4. **Deep Dive into Key Components**:
   - Discuss database schema, caching strategy, or API design in detail.
5. **Address Bottlenecks**:
   - Identify potential issues (e.g., single point of failure, scalability limits) and propose solutions.
6. **Optimize**:
   - Suggest improvements (e.g., sharding, replication, CDN usage).

## Common System Design Patterns

- **Client-Server Model**: Clients request services, and servers provide them.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: Nodes communicate directly without a central server.
- **Master-Slave Replication**: One master node handles writes, and slave nodes replicate data for reads.
- **Sharding**: Splits data across multiple databases to distribute load.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components react to events (e.g., user actions, system triggers).

## Real-World Examples to Study

- **TinyURL**: Design a URL shortening service.
- **Twitter**: Design a social media feed system.
- **Uber**: Design a ride-sharing system.
- **Netflix**: Design a video streaming platform.
- **Dropbox**: Design a file storage and sharing system.

## Tools and Technologies to Know

- **Databases**: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra).
- **Caching**: Redis, Memcached.
- **Load Balancers**: NGINX, HAProxy.
- **Message Queues**: Kafka, RabbitMQ.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (S3, EC2, RDS), Google Cloud, Azure.

## Tips for Acing System Design Interviews

- **Communicate Clearly**: Explain your thought process and reasoning.
- **Think Aloud**: Interviewers want to see how you approach problems.
- **Focus on Trade-offs**: Discuss pros and cons of your design choices (e.g., consistency vs. availability).
- **Be Flexible**: Adapt your design based on feedback or new constraints.
- **Practice**: Use resources like Grokking the System Design Interview, YouTube tutorials, or mock interviews.
