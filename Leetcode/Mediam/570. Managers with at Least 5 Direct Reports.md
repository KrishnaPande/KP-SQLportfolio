Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

#### My Solution 1:
Tried using self join
```sql
select name 
from (SELECT e.id, e.name
FROM Employee e
join Employee e2
on e.id = e2.managerId
group by 1, 2
having COUNT(e.id) >= 5)
```

#### Another Solution: Withoud Self Join Correct Approach


```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Employee e
JOIN (
    SELECT managerId FROM Employee
    GROUP BY managerId HAVING COUNT(0) >=5
) m ON e.id = m.managerId;
```

Using COUNT(0) is functionally equivalent to COUNT(*) or COUNT(1), as they all count the rows without considering specific column values.
