If you want to concatenate values lexicographically (in alphabetical order) within each group in PostgreSQL, you can specify the ordering within STRING_AGG.

STRING_AGG(product, ', ' ORDER BY product) will concatenate product values in lexicographical order within each group, using ORDER BY product.

GROUP BY category groups the rows by category.



```sql
select  sell_Date, COUNT(DISTINCT product) as num_sold,
        string_AGG(DISTINCT product, ',' order by product) as products
from Activities
group by 1
order by 1
```
