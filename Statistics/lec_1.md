Great! With 2 days, we can cover the **basics of statistics** and go through **problem-solving techniques** that are common in interviews for data-related roles.

## ‚úÖ Day 1: Basic Statistics for Interviews

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**

* **Mean** ‚Äì average of values.
* **Median** ‚Äì middle value in sorted data.
* **Mode** ‚Äì most frequent value.
* **Range** ‚Äì max - min.
* **Variance** ‚Äì how far values spread from the mean.
* **Standard Deviation (SD)** ‚Äì square root of variance.

üìå **Problem Example:**

> Given the data: \[2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9], calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and SD.

---

### 2. **Types of Data**

* **Quantitative**: Numerical (age, income).
* **Qualitative**: Categorical (gender, country).
* **Discrete vs. Continuous**: Integer counts vs. real numbers.
* **Nominal vs. Ordinal**: Categories without/with order.

üìå **Problem Example:**

> Classify data types for these: Blood type, temperature, salary, satisfaction score (1‚Äì5).

---

### 3. **Probability Basics**

* **Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes)**
* **Mutually Exclusive Events**: P(A ‚à© B) = 0
* **Independent Events**: P(A ‚à© B) = P(A) √ó P(B)

üìå **Problem Example:**

> What is the probability of drawing a red card or a king from a deck of 52 cards?

---

### 4. **Distributions**

* **Normal distribution** ‚Äì bell-shaped curve.
* **Skewness** ‚Äì asymmetry.
* **Kurtosis** ‚Äì peakedness.

---

## ‚úÖ Day 2: Problem Solving Techniques

### 1. **Business & Analytical Thinking**

* Break down problems into:

  * Inputs
  * Processes
  * Outputs
  * Constraints

üìå **Problem Example:**

> A company‚Äôs online sales dropped last month. What steps would you take to investigate the issue?

---

### 2. **Case Study Practice**

* E.g., *‚ÄúHow would you design a dashboard for customer retention?‚Äù*
* Structure your approach:

  * Understand goal
  * List metrics (e.g., churn rate)
  * Choose visuals (e.g., bar charts, KPIs)
  * Suggest actions

---

### 3. **Common Metrics**

* **Churn Rate** = Lost customers / Total customers
* **Conversion Rate** = Conversions / Visitors
* **Growth Rate** = (New - Old) / Old

---

### 4. **Interview Tips**

* Always **explain your thinking**.
* If stuck, **clarify assumptions**.
* Use simple visuals or examples to explain.
