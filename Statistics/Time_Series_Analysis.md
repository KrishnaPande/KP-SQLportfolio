**Time Series Analysis in Data Science** is a powerful technique used to analyze data that is collected over time. It's commonly applied in areas like finance, economics, weather forecasting, stock market prediction, sensor data analysis, and much more.

### üìå What is a Time Series?

A **time series** is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at time-ordered intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly).

Example:

```
Date         | Temperature (¬∞C)
-------------|----------------
2025-01-01   | 22
2025-01-02   | 21
2025-01-03   | 23
...          | ...
```

### üîç Objectives of Time Series Analysis

1. **Understanding** the underlying structure and function that produced the data.
2. **Forecasting** future values based on previously observed values.
3. **Detecting anomalies** or significant deviations in trends.
4. **Evaluating impact** of events over time (e.g., policy changes, interventions).

### üß† Key Components of Time Series

1. **Trend**: Long-term increase or decrease in the data.
2. **Seasonality**: Repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over fixed periods (e.g., monthly, yearly).
3. **Cyclic Patterns**: Fluctuations not of fixed period (e.g., economic cycles).
4. **Noise**: Random variation or residuals that cannot be explained by the model.

### üìà Time Series Forecasting Example Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather time-stamped data.
2. **Preprocessing**:

   * Handle missing data
   * Resample or aggregate
   * Normalize/standardize
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Plot the series, look at autocorrelations.
4. **Decomposition**: Separate trend, seasonality, and noise.
5. **Modeling**: Apply appropriate forecasting techniques.
6. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
7. **Prediction**: Forecast future data points.

### üõ† Popular Tools & Libraries

* **Python**:

  * `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `prophet`, `pmdarima`
* **R**:

  * `forecast`, `tseries`, `xts`, `zoo`
* **Others**: TensorFlow, PyTorch (for deep learning models)
