"Measuring impact" typically refers to evaluating how effective a change, product, or decision is â€” especially in business, product development, marketing, and social programs.

### If you're asking **"what is all the testing to learn"** under this topic, hereâ€™s a clear breakdown:

---

## ðŸ§ª **Types of Testing to Learn and Measure Impact**

### 1. **A/B Testing (Split Testing)**

* **What it is:** Compare two versions (A and B) of something (e.g., webpage, email, button) to see which performs better.
* **Goal:** Identify which variant leads to higher conversions, clicks, or other metrics.
* **Learn:** What specific changes improve performance.

---

### 2. **Multivariate Testing**

* **What it is:** Test multiple variables (not just A vs B) simultaneously to see how combinations affect outcomes.
* **Goal:** Understand how different design elements interact and influence behavior.
* **Learn:** Which combination of elements works best.

---

### 3. **Pre/Post Testing**

* **What it is:** Measure results before and after a change or intervention.
* **Goal:** Identify whether the change made a measurable impact.
* **Learn:** If the change caused improvement (e.g., before/after a campaign or feature release).

---

### 4. **Incrementality Testing**

* **What it is:** Test what would happen without an intervention (using a control group).
* **Goal:** Isolate the true impact of your actions.
* **Learn:** What part of the result is *caused by* your campaign vs what would have happened anyway.

---

### 5. **Holdout Testing**

* **What it is:** Withhold a portion of users from receiving a change to compare outcomes.
* **Goal:** Get a clean control group for comparison.
* **Learn:** Real impact of the change vs background noise.

---

### 6. **User Surveys / Feedback Testing**

* **What it is:** Collect direct input from users before and after changes.
* **Goal:** Understand qualitative impact (user satisfaction, usability).
* **Learn:** Why users do or donâ€™t respond well to changes.

---

### 7. **Cohort Analysis**

* **What it is:** Segment users into cohorts (e.g., by signup date) and track behavior over time.
* **Goal:** Compare engagement or retention across different groups.
* **Learn:** How changes affect user behavior long-term.

---

### 8. **Causal Inference (Advanced)**

* **What it is:** Use statistical techniques (e.g., regression, propensity scores) to estimate cause-and-effect.
* **Goal:** Understand deeper impacts when A/B testing is not possible.
* **Learn:** Likely impact of an intervention on different segments or over time.

---

## ðŸ§  Summary: What You Learn

From these tests, you can learn:

* Which features, designs, or campaigns work best
* How much change is due to your actions vs other factors
* How different segments respond differently
* Whether short-term gains lead to long-term improvements

If you tell me **your specific goal or area** (e.g., product, marketing, social impact, personal development), I can tailor which tests are best for measuring impact in that context.
