Hypothesis testing is a statistical tool used to determine if the results of an experiment are meaningful or not.
 It involves setting up a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, which are mutually exclusive.
 The null hypothesis assumes there is no difference between two possibilities and that any observed differences are due to chance alone.
 Hypothesis testing helps to conclude whether the null hypothesis can be rejected or not.
