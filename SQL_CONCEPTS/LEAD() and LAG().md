### 1. Using LEAD() and LAG() for Leading and Lagging Dates

PostgreSQL has built-in window functions LEAD() and LAG() that help retrieve the next or previous row in the result set based on a specific order. This is useful for calculating leading and lagging dates.

```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    LEAD(value) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS next_day_value,
    LAG(value) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS previous_day_value
FROM 
    your_table;
```
