The decision between using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and joins in SQL, particularly in PostgreSQL, depends on the specific context of your query, readability needs, and performance considerations. Here are some guidelines on when to use each:

**When to Use CTEs**
1. For Improved Readability and Organization

**Complex Queries**: CTEs help break down complex queries into simpler parts. By creating "subqueries" in an organized way, you can build up logic step by step, which makes the query easier to understand.
**Reusability**: If you need to refer to the same intermediate result multiple times within a single query, defining it as a CTE can keep the query cleaner.
sql
```SQL
WITH recent_orders AS (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*)
FROM recent_orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

***2. Recursive Queries***

CTEs support recursion, which makes them ideal for hierarchical data structures, like finding a chain of related records or querying tree-like structures (e.g., organizational hierarchies).
sql
Copy code
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE hierarchy AS (
    SELECT id, name, parent_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE parent_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.parent_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN hierarchy h ON e.parent_id = h.id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy;
```

**3. For Temporary Calculations or Filtering**

Intermediate Results: Use CTEs to calculate temporary values or to filter intermediate results. You can then use these results in subsequent parts of your query without cluttering the main query logic.
Performance Tuning (in Specific Cases): While joins are often more performant for simpler conditions, CTEs can sometimes improve performance by allowing the database to process intermediate steps separately.
When to Use Joins

1. When Query Performance is Crucial (Non-Recursive Queries)

Direct Relationships: Joins are usually faster than CTEs for simple lookups between related tables, especially if you’re not performing complex calculations between them.
Optimization Opportunities: Database query planners are often better at optimizing joins, which can reduce execution time when you only need to combine tables without complex, intermediate steps.

```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

**2. For Simple Data Retrieval and Filtering**

1. Joins are ideal for straightforward data retrieval when you’re working with simple one-to-one or one-to-many relationships.
2. Use joins when you just need to combine tables based on certain conditions without breaking down the logic into multiple steps.

**3. To Perform Aggregations Across Multiple Tables**

When aggregating data across related tables (such as calculating totals or averages based on values from multiple tables), joins are often more efficient.

```sql
SELECT customers.id, COUNT(orders.id) AS total_orders
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.id;
```
