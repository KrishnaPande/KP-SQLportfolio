UNION: Combines the results of two queries, eliminating duplicate rows.

sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
UNION ALL: Combines the results of two queries, including duplicate rows.

sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
INTERSECT: Returns only the rows present in both queries.

sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;

EXCEPT: Returns only the rows from the first query that are not present in the second query.

sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
Key Points:
Columns in both queries must have the same data types.
You can use ORDER BY only at the end of the combined result.
