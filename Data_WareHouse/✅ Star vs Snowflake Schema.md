## ⭐ **Star Schema**

### 🧠 What is it?

A **simple and intuitive** design where:

* A **central Fact table** holds metrics (sales, revenue, etc.)
* It’s connected directly to multiple **Dimension tables** (date, product, customer, etc.)

### 🔧 Structure:

Looks like a star — the **fact table** is in the middle, **dimension tables** are like arms.

```
           Date
            |
Product — Fact — Customer  
            |
         Region
```

### ✅ Pros:

* Fast performance (joins are simple)
* Easy for BI tools and end users
* Great for reporting and dashboards

### ❌ Cons:

* Some **data redundancy** in dimensions (repeated values)

---

## ❄️ **Snowflake Schema**

### 🧠 What is it?

A **more normalized** version of Star Schema:

* Dimensions are broken into **sub-dimensions**
* More tables, more joins

### 🔧 Structure:

Looks like a snowflake — complex branches from dimensions.

```
          Date
           |
     Product_Category
           |
Product — Fact — Customer — Customer_Region  
           |
         Region
```

### ✅ Pros:

* **Less redundancy**, storage efficient
* Data is more organized and consistent

### ❌ Cons:

* Slower performance (more joins)
* More complex to query and manage

## 🔷 FACT TABLE

### 🧠 What is it?

A **Fact Table** stores **measurable**, **quantifiable data** — numbers you want to **analyze**.

> Think: "What do I want to calculate or track?"

### 📦 Contains:

* **Keys** to dimension tables (foreign keys)
* **Metrics/measures** (e.g., revenue, quantity, cost)

### 🧪 Example: `Sales_Fact`

| Order\_ID | Date\_ID | Product\_ID | Customer\_ID | Revenue | Quantity |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------- | -------- |

### ✅ Characteristics:

* Large in size
* Grows over time (more events, more facts)
* Usually denormalized

---

## 🟨 DIMENSION TABLE

### 🧠 What is it?

A **Dimension Table** stores **descriptive** data — used to **filter**, **group**, and **label** facts.

> Think: "How do I want to slice and dice my data?"

### 📦 Contains:

* Attributes that describe **the who, what, when, where**
* **Primary Key** (referenced in fact table)

### 🧪 Example: `Customer_Dim`

| Customer\_ID | Name     | Gender | Country |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ | ------- |
| 101          | John Doe | Male   | USA     |
| 102          | Priya K  | Female | India   |

## 📌 Key Differences

| Feature      | 🟦 Fact Table         | 🟨 Dimension Table     |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Contains     | Numbers, Metrics      | Descriptive attributes |
| Size         | Very large            | Smaller                |
| Primary Key  | No (has foreign keys) | Yes                    |
| Relationship | Depends on dimensions | Independent            |
| Example      | Sales, Orders         | Product, Customer      |
| Used for     | Aggregation           | Filtering/Labeling     |

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine a **restaurant**:

* 🍽️ **Fact Table** = Orders (what was ordered, when, how much, total bill)
* 🧍 **Dimension Table** = Customer info, Food menu, Table location

---

## 🔁 How They Work Together:

```text
              ┌────────────┐
              │  Date_Dim  │
              └────┬───────┘
                   │
     ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
     │             │             │
┌────▼────┐   ┌────▼────┐   ┌────▼────┐
│ Product │   │  Fact   │   │Customer │
│  _Dim   │   │  Table  │   │  _Dim   │
└─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘
```

---

## ✅ Pro Tips:

* Every **fact** needs at least **one dimension** to give it meaning.
* **Fact tables** are where analytics happens; **dimension tables** help users explore data.

### **Galaxy Schema (Fact Constellation) in Data Warehousing**  

The **Galaxy Schema**, also known as **Fact Constellation**, is an advanced multidimensional data model used in data warehousing. It combines features of **Star Schema** and **Snowflake Schema** but allows for more complex relationships by **sharing dimension tables across multiple fact tables**.  

---

## **Key Features of Galaxy Schema**  
1. **Multiple Fact Tables**  
   - Unlike Star Schema (single fact table), Galaxy Schema has **several interconnected fact tables**.  
   - Example:  
     - `Fact_Sales`  
     - `Fact_Inventory`  
     - `Fact_Shipping`  

2. **Shared Dimension Tables**  
   - Dimension tables are reused across fact tables to avoid redundancy.  
   - Example:  
     - `Dim_Time` (used by both `Fact_Sales` and `Fact_Shipping`)  
     - `Dim_Product` (shared across `Fact_Sales` and `Fact_Inventory`)  

3. **Supports Complex Business Processes**  
   - Ideal for scenarios where multiple business processes (sales, logistics, inventory) need to be analyzed together.  

4. **Normalized & Denormalized Mix**  
   - Some dimensions are normalized (like Snowflake), while others are denormalized (like Star Schema).  

---

## **Example: Retail Data Warehouse**  
Consider an e-commerce company tracking **sales, inventory, and shipping**:  

### **Fact Tables**  
| Fact Table       | Description | Linked Dimensions |  
|-----------------|------------|------------------|  
| `Fact_Sales`    | Tracks orders, revenue | `Dim_Date`, `Dim_Product`, `Dim_Customer`, `Dim_Store` |  
| `Fact_Inventory`| Tracks stock levels | `Dim_Date`, `Dim_Product`, `Dim_Warehouse` |  
| `Fact_Shipping` | Tracks deliveries | `Dim_Date`, `Dim_Product`, `Dim_Shipping_Carrier` |  

### **Shared Dimensions**  
- `Dim_Date` → Used by all fact tables.  
- `Dim_Product` → Used by `Fact_Sales` and `Fact_Inventory`.  

---

## **Advantages of Galaxy Schema**  
✔ **Reduces Data Redundancy** (shared dimensions save storage).  
✔ **Supports Complex Queries** (e.g., "Compare sales vs. inventory levels by product").  
✔ **Flexible for Evolving Business Needs** (new fact tables can be added without redesign).  

## **Disadvantages**  
❌ **More Complex Than Star Schema** (harder to design & maintain).  
❌ **Slower Query Performance** (if joins are not optimized).  
❌ **Requires Careful ETL Design** (to avoid inconsistencies in shared dimensions).  

---

## **Galaxy vs. Star vs. Snowflake Schema**  

| Feature          | Star Schema | Snowflake Schema | Galaxy Schema |  
|----------------|------------|------------------|--------------|  
| **Fact Tables** | Single | Single | Multiple |  
| **Dimensions** | Denormalized | Normalized | Mix of both |  
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |  
| **Query Speed** | Fast | Slower (due to joins) | Moderate (depends on joins) |  
| **Best For** | Simple analytics | Storage efficiency | Complex business processes |  

---

### **When to Use Galaxy Schema?**  
- When **multiple business processes** need to be analyzed together (e.g., sales + logistics).  
- When **shared dimensions** (like `Dim_Date`) are used across different fact tables.  
- When historical trends across **different operational areas** must be compared.  

**Example Use Cases:**  
- Retail (sales + inventory + returns analysis)  
- Banking (transactions + loans + customer behavior)  
- Healthcare (patient visits + lab tests + billing)

### **Surrogate Keys vs. Natural Keys in Data Warehousing**

#### **1. Natural Keys**  
- **Definition:** A **natural key** is a field (or combination of fields) that **naturally identifies a record** in the real world.  
- **Examples:**  
  - `EmployeeID` (assigned by HR)  
  - `Passport Number` (government-issued)  
  - `Product SKU` (assigned by manufacturer)  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ Already exists in source systems (no extra generation needed).  
✔ Business-friendly (easy to understand).  

❌ **Cons:**  
✖ Can change over time (e.g., a customer changes their email).  
✖ May be non-numeric (slower joins in large tables).  
✖ Composite keys (multiple columns) complicate joins.  

---

#### **2. Surrogate Keys**  
- **Definition:** A **surrogate key** is an **artificial, system-generated identifier** (usually an auto-incremented number or UUID) with no business meaning.  
- **Examples:**  
  - `CustomerID` (auto-generated: 101, 102, 103)  
  - `OrderID` (UUID: `a1b2c3d4-5678-9101`)  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔ **Never changes** (stable for historical tracking).  
✔ **Simpler joins** (single-column, numeric = faster performance).  
✔ **Handles SCDs (Slowly Changing Dimensions)** better (e.g., Type 2 changes).  

❌ **Cons:**  
✖ No business meaning (requires mapping to natural keys).  
✖ Extra storage (but negligible in modern databases).  

---

### **Key Differences**  

| Feature          | Natural Key | Surrogate Key |  
|----------------|------------|--------------|  
| **Source** | From real-world data | System-generated |  
| **Stability** | Can change (e.g., email updates) | Never changes |  
| **Performance** | Slower (if string-based) | Faster (integer-based) |  
| **Use Case** | Operational systems (OLTP) | Data warehouses (OLAP) |  

---

### **When to Use Which?**  
#### **✅ Use Natural Keys When:**  
- Working with **OLTP systems** (e.g., transactional databases).  
- The key is **guaranteed unique & stable** (e.g., ISBN for books).  

#### **✅ Use Surrogate Keys When:**  
- Building a **data warehouse** (for consistency & performance).  
- Handling **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)**.  
- The natural key is **composite or unstable** (e.g., `FirstName + LastName + DOB`).  

---

### **Example in a Data Warehouse**  
#### **Dimension Table (`Dim_Customer`)**  
| **CustomerSK** (Surrogate) | **CustomerNK** (Natural) | Name | Email |  
|------------------|------------------|--------|----------------|  
| 101 | CUST-1001 | John Doe | john@example.com |  
| 102 | CUST-1002 | Jane Smith | jane@example.com |  

- `CustomerSK` (Surrogate Key) → Used for **joins in the DWH**.  
- `CustomerNK` (Natural Key) → Used for **matching source systems**.  

---

### **Best Practices**  
1. **Always include both keys** in dimensions:  
   - `Surrogate Key` → For joins.  
   - `Natural Key` → For ETL mapping.  
2. **Use integers for surrogate keys** (better indexing).  
3. **Avoid business logic in surrogate keys** (keep them meaningless).
