---

## ✅ **2. Architecture of Data Warehouse**

* 2-tier vs 3-tier Architecture
* Components:

  * Data Sources
  * ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
  * Staging Area
  * Data Warehouse Layer
  * Data Marts
  * Metadata
  * Query Tools

---

## ✅ **3. Data Modeling in Data Warehouse**

* **Dimensional Modeling:**

  * Star Schema
  * Snowflake Schema
  * Galaxy/Fact Constellation Schema
* **Types of Tables:**

  * Fact Table (Transactional, Snapshot, Accumulating)
  * Dimension Table (Slowly Changing Dimensions - SCD Types 0 to 6)
* Surrogate Keys vs Natural Keys

---

## ✅ **4. ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)**

* What is ETL?
* Steps in ETL

  * Data Extraction (Incremental vs Full Load)
  * Data Transformation (cleansing, standardizing, enriching)

---

## ✅ **6. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**

* SCD Type 0 to Type 6

  * SCD Type 1: Overwrite
  * SCD Type 2: Versioning
  * SCD Type 3: Add new column
* Use cases for each

---

## ✅ **7. Data Warehouse Design**

* Top-down vs Bottom-up Approach
* Kimball vs Inmon Methodologies
* Bus Architecture
* Grain of Fact Table

---

## ✅ **8. Data Marts**

* What are Data Marts?
* Dependent vs Independent Data Marts
* Usage and Benefits

---

## ✅ **9. Performance Optimization**

* Materialized Views
* Denormalization in DW

---

## ✅ **10. Reporting & BI Integration**

* Query optimization for BI
* Semantic Layer

---

## ✅ **11. Cloud Data Warehousing**

* Amazon Redshift
* Google BigQuery
* Snowflake
* Azure Synapse Analytics
* Pricing, Scaling, Security, and Integration

---

## ✅ **12. Real-time vs Batch Processing**

* Lambda Architecture
* Kappa Architecture
* Near Real-Time ETL tools (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming)

---

## ✅ **13. Data Lake vs Data Warehouse**

* Use cases and when to choose which
* Lakehouse Architecture

---

## ✅ **14. Data Governance & Security**

* Data Lineage
* Access Controls (Role-based access)
* Data Masking
