**Metadata** is often described as **"data about data"**—it provides information about other data, making it easier to organize, discover, understand, and manage.  

### **Types of Metadata:**
1. **Descriptive Metadata** – Helps identify and locate data (e.g., title, author, keywords, date created).  
   - *Example:* A photo’s metadata may include the date taken, camera model, and location.  

2. **Structural Metadata** – Shows how data is organized (e.g., file format, relationships between files).  
   - *Example:* A book’s chapters and their order in an eBook.  

3. **Administrative Metadata** – Helps manage resources (e.g., file permissions, creation date, access rights).  
   - *Example:* A document’s edit history or copyright information.  

4. **Technical Metadata** – Describes technical aspects (e.g., file type, compression, software used).  
   - *Example:* The resolution and bitrate of a video file.  

5. **Preservation Metadata** – Used for long-term archiving (e.g., checksums, storage conditions).  
   - *Example:* Digital library records ensuring files remain usable over time.  

### **Common Uses of Metadata:**
- **Search & Retrieval:** Helps search engines and databases categorize content.  
- **Data Management:** Ensures proper storage, backup, and compliance.  
- **Privacy & Security:** Tracks data access and usage (e.g., GDPR compliance).  
- **Interoperability:** Allows different systems to exchange and interpret data.  

### **Examples in Everyday Life:**
- **Email Metadata:** Sender, recipient, timestamp, subject line.  
- **Music Files:** Artist, album, genre, track length.  
- **Web Pages:** HTML meta tags (description, keywords for SEO).
