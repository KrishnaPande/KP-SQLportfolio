Here are the key takeaways:

A framework provides context by connecting your data to the business task and metrics.
Start with the business task, which is the question or problem your data analysis aims to answer.
Clearly outline your presentation, connecting each part to the business task.
Use data visualizations to illustrate your points and connect them to the business task.
Explain the business metrics used, helping your audience understand the impact of your findings.
Remember, a clear framework helps your audience understand and connect with your data, making your presentation more effective.

This lecture focuses on how to effectively incorporate data into presentations to enhance your audience's understanding. 

Here are some key takeaways:

* **Contextualize your data**: Explain the data sources, relevance, and limitations to your audience.
* **Start with your hypothesis**: Clearly state your initial hypothesis to provide context for your data.
* **Use visualizations and examples**: Simplify complex data and improve audience engagement.
* **Apply the McCandless Method**: Introduce your graphics, answer potential questions, state insights, provide supporting data, and explain the significance.
* **Focus on audience impact**: Clearly articulate the "so what" by connecting your insights to actionable takeaways for your audience.

An initial hypothesis is like an educated guess you're trying to prove or disprove with data. 

For example, imagine your business task is to increase sales for a clothing store. Your initial hypothesis might be: " Offering a discount on clothes 
will increase sales".  You would then collect and analyze data to see if the discount leads to an increase in sales, thus proving or disproving your 
hypothesis.

## McCandless Method

The McCandless Method is a five-step approach for presenting data visualizations in a clear and engaging way. Think of it like building a pyramid, starting with a broad base and moving to a pointed top:

1. Introduce the Graphic: Start by stating the title or type of visualization. This focuses your audience's attention.
2. Answer Obvious Questions: Anticipate your audience's questions and address them upfront. Begin with high-level information and gradually delve into specifics.
3. State the Insight: Clearly articulate the key takeaway message your visualization conveys.
4. Provide Supporting Data: Highlight specific data points within the visualization that support your stated insight.
5. Explain Why it Matters: Connect the insight to its significance. Explain the "so what?" and discuss potential implications or actions.

This method helps your audience understand and remember the information presented in your data visualizations.  


### *Example*

Let's imagine you're presenting data on avocado search trends using the two graphs from the "Share Data Through the Art of Visualization" course. Here's how you can apply the McCandless Method:

Graph 1: Yearly Avocado Search Trends

Introduce the Graphic: "This line graph, titled 'Yearly Avocado Search Trends,' illustrates the search interest in avocados over several years."

Answer Obvious Questions: "The data represents online searches for the term 'avocado' and was collected from a search engine's database. It covers the period from [Start Year] to [End Year]."

State the Insight: "The graph reveals a consistent upward trend in avocado searches over the years, indicating a growing interest in avocados."

Provide Supporting Data: "Look at the line's trajectory—it steadily rises each year, particularly from [Year] onwards."

Explain Why it Matters: "This upward trend suggests a strong market for avocados, encouraging grocery stores to stock accordingly and potentially explore avocado-related promotions."
Graph 2: Monthly Avocado Search Trends

Introduce the Graphic: "This circular heatmap visualizes monthly avocado search trends over a year."

Answer Obvious Questions: "The circle represents a year, with winter months at the top and summer at the bottom. The further a segment is from the center, the higher the search volume for 'avocado' during that month."

State the Insight: "Interestingly, while avocados are a summer fruit, the peak search interest occurs in January and February, likely due to the Super Bowl and its association with guacamole."

Provide Supporting Data: "Notice how January and February, despite being winter months, are furthest from the center, indicating peak search volume."

Explain Why it Matters: "This insight highlights the impact of events on consumer behavior and can inform targeted marketing campaigns for avocados during the Super Bowl season."
By following the McCandless Method, you can present these graphs in a way that is clear, engaging, and insightful for your audience.

### Effective presentation practices

When exploring a slide presentation, use your knowledge of effective presentation practices to evaluate it. This includes reviewing your own work! When you’re checking over slide presentations, there are some best practices you can check for: 

* **Include a title, subtitle, and date**: Making sure that your slide deck presentation has a title, subtitle, and date makes sure that your audience knows exactly what you are presenting and when the information was from. That way they know it’s relevant and current to them!

* **Use a logical sequence of slides**: Organizing your slides in an order that makes sense guides your audience through your narrative, building understanding step by step.

* **Provide an agenda with a timeline**: An agenda offers a roadmap of your presentation, allowing your audience to follow along and anticipate key topics.

* **Limit the amount of text on slides**: Keeping text brief ensures clarity and retains the audience’s attention; aim for your audience to scan it within 5 seconds.

* **Start with the business task**: By immediately relating the content to the business task at hand, you contextualize your information, making it relevant and actionable.

* **Establish the initial hypothesis**: Presenting an initial hypothesis gives your audience a starting point for what to expect and frames the subsequent analysis.

* **Show what business metrics you used**: Clarifying which metrics you're analyzing validates your arguments and helps the audience gauge your presentation's relevance to business outcomes.

* **Use visualizations**: Visual aids can illustrate complex data more effectively than text alone, making your message more accessible.

* **Introduce the graphic by name**: A brief introduction to each graphic aids in understanding and retaining information.

* **Provide a title for each graph**: Titles act as signposts, helping the audience quickly grasp the meaning of each visual.

* **Go from the general to the specific**: Starting with a broad overview before diving into details ensures that all audience members are on the same page.

* **Use speaker notes to help you remember talking points**: Notes act as your cue cards, enabling a smoother delivery and ensuring no critical point is missed.

* **Include key takeaways**: Summarizing the main points at the end of your presentation reinforces the message and ensures the audience leaves with the intended takeaways.

Like so many parts of your job as a data professional, creating presentations is an iterative process. Reviewing your work, making changes as needed, and improving it when you can will make your presentations clearer and more useful for stakeholders.

An **_"eyesore chart"_** refers to a chart or graph that is visually cluttered, overwhelming, and difficult to understand.  Brittany mentions that these charts often have excessive data, colors, and a generally busy appearance, making it hard for the audience to decipher the intended message.

### Messy data presentation
In the first video, watch and listen carefully for the specific reasons the “messy” presentation falls short. Here is a preview:

* No story or logical flow
* No titles
* Too much text
* Inconsistent format (no theme)
* No recommendation or conclusion at the end

### Good data presentation

In the second video, numerous best practices are applied to create a better presentation on the same topic. This “good” presentation is so much easier to understand than the messy one! Here is a preview:

* Title and date the presentation was last updated
* Flow or table of contents
* Transition slides
* Visual introduction to the data (also used as a repeated theme)
* Animated bullet points
* Annotations on top of visuals
* Logic and progression
* Limitations to the data (caveats) - what the data can’t tell you
