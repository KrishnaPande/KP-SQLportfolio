#### This content focuses on design thinking and how to apply it to data visualization to make it more user-centered.

### What is Design Thinking?

- Design thinking is a process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way.
- When you bring design thinking into your work, you're trying to identify alternative strategies that might not be clear right away.

### How Can Design Thinking Be Used in Data Visualization?

- Airbnb used design thinking to improve its product and increase revenue.
- Data visualization is the perfect stage of your analysis to apply a user-based mindset.

- What are the Five Phases of Design Thinking in Data Visualization?

1. Empathize: Thinking about the emotions and needs of the target audience for the data visualization
2. Define: Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data
3. Ideate: Generating ideas for data visualization
4. Prototype: Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback
5. Test: Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them

These phases don't have to follow a set order.

#### This section emphasizes the importance of making data visualizations accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. 

### Accessibility Considerations:

**Direct Labeling**: Label data directly on the visualization instead of relying solely on legends, making it easier to understand for everyone.

**Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for all non-text content, such as descriptions of charts and graphs, so that information is accessible to those with visual impairments.

### Simplified Visualizations:

**Avoid Overcomplication**: Keep visualizations clean and easy to understand, avoiding excessive information or complexity.

**Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Use contrasting colors and simple designs to make it clear what to focus on and to aid those with visual impairments.

Follow this high level 60-minute chart to guide your thinking whenever you begin working on a data visualization. 

**Prep (5 min)**: Create the mental and physical space necessary for an environment of comprehensive thinking. This means allowing yourself room to brainstorm how you want your data to appear while considering the amount and type of data that you have.

**Talk and listen (15 min)**: Identify the object of your work by getting to the “ask behind the ask” and establishing expectations. Ask questions and really concentrate on feedback from stakeholders regarding your projects to help you hone how to lay out your data. 

**Sketch and design (20 min)**: Draft your approach to the problem. Define the timing and output of your work to get a clear and concise idea of what you are crafting.

**Prototype and improve (20 min)**: Generate a visual solution and gauge its effectiveness at accurately communicating your data. Take your time and repeat the process until a final visual is produced. It is alright if you go through several visuals until you find the perfect fit. 

#### **Key takeaways**

This is a great overview you can use when you need to create a visualization in a short amount of time. As you become more experienced in data visualization, you will find yourself creating your own process. You will get a more detailed description of different visualization options in the next reading, including line charts, bar charts, scatterplots, and more. No matter what you choose, always remember to take the time to prep, identify your objective, take in feedback, design, and create.
